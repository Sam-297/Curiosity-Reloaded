# Curiosity Reloaded

## Description
Curiosity Reloaded is a project aimed at optimizing the navigation of the Mars rover Curiosity by developing a compact language using linked lists. This language allows the rover to execute routines efficiently while exploring the Martian terrain.

## Project Structure
- `main.c`: Main program file responsible for executing the Curiosity routines.
- `listes.c`, `listes.h`: Modules for managing linked lists.
- `interprete.c`, `interprete.h`: Module for interpreting Curiosity routines.
- `curiosity.c`, `curiosity.h`: Module for managing the Curiosity rover.
- `Makefile`: File for compiling the C code.
- `tests/`: Directory containing test files for Curiosity routines.
- `tests/performance/`: Directory containing performance test files.

## Instructions
1. Compile the project using the provided Makefile.
2. Execute the compiled program passing a test file as an argument (e.g., `./main test/simple.test`).
3. Review the output to ensure correct interpretation and execution of Curiosity routines.

## Contributing
Contributions to improve the efficiency and functionality of Curiosity Reloaded are welcome. Please fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request for review.

Note: I did not make the `tests/` folder.
